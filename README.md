# crashScraping
Basic Python script in progress. The goal of this project is to familiarize 
myself with both Python and web scraping.

# Purpose
Pull data from https://roobet.com/crash using Beautiful Soup. I plan to parse and add data 
to a .csv file for analytics purposes. 

I already had a Java parser specific to the crash data, so I simply just wrote the 
Python output to a file and read it from the Java parser. 

# Usage
You can download the source code and simply run 
``` javac mainClass.java ```
``` java mainClass.java ```
and look at the output.txt for the crash data.
